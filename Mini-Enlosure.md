# Table Enclosure

### Instructions for running and using the Table enclosure. 

- The table enclosure needs to be run by two people. One person will being working with their arms within the enclosure while another works under the enclosure cutting the ampules. 

- The enclosure needs to be filled with Argon gas to prevent oxidization of the elements(potassium and Sodium) 

- Connect the argon tank to the valve on the side of the enclosure while filling the tank. It only needs to be set to 10.

- The tank will fill and the oxygen will leave via the valve on the top of the enclosure. Make sure this valve is open. 

- After about fifteen minutes the tank should be full. At any time you can put your arms in the gloves to check the level of oxygen in the enclosure. The Reader inside the enclosure should be around 3.33.

- Please note that pulling your arms out of the gloves and putting them in will effect the pressure of the enclosure. If you pull the gloves out while the valve is open you will pull oxygen into the enclosure. Have your work partner close the valve before pulling your arms out. to avoid displacing the atmosphere

- Once the atmosphere is set you can begin prepping the ampules for cutting. Cut a section of element about half and inch long and maybe a quarter inch thick. stuff the element  down into an ampule. if the element has a hard time fitting you can roll it up in your fingers. 

- When the ampule is full, put it into one of the three slots by pushing it through. forcing whatever ampule that is already in the slot though. Using this approach will maintain the developed atmosphere. 

- If it seems really difficult to push it through you can coat the ampule with a little mineral oil. This shouldn't need to be done every time, only when needed. 

*Cutting*

- When you are cutting the ampules hold the torches as flat as you can to avoid burning the box itself. 

- The element will need to be warmed up before cutting, quickly run the torch over the bottom of the ampule. Stop when the element melts slightly. It may bubble a bit, that is normal. 

- Holding the ampule with the forceps begin cutting the ampule with the twin torches by moving them back and forth. (front to back) touching your hand to the box(bottom of the enclosure) can help steady the flame and help keep you level. Helping avoid burning the box. 

- Once the ampule is cut through set the finished sample into a wooden ampule block for cooling.

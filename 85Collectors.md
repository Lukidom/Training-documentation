## Elements



**1.**  **Hydrogen**


*Create hydrogen gas*
 
- Fill up an Erlenmayer flask ( glass beaker that gets smaller at top) with water.


- Get a ballon ready
- drop about 10 Calcium pellets into the water-filled flack and immediately stretch the opening of the ballon over the opening of the flask. 
- The calcium will react with the water and the ballon will inflate with hydrogen gas. Make sure that the ballon does not come fo the flask. the bottom of the flask may become hot from the reaction. This is normal. 
- When the reaction has finished or the ballon is becoming too full, twist the ballon to trap in the air. then carefully remove the ballon and tie is closed. If you had to remove the ballon before then reaction is complete due to and excess amount of calcium being added to the water, then yoj can add another ballon to get more gas. 
- The water and byproducts of the reaction in the flask can safely be pouted down the drain with running water. 
- using a 60cc syringe with a needle on the end, stab into the ballon close to where it is tied in a knot. Fill up the syringe with the gas. You can twist the balloon below the hole that you made and then clamp it off the kelly forceps until you are ready to fill the syringe again. 

*Put the Gas into glass ampules*

- fill up the aluminum block with ampules and light the torch. Put the syringe with a needle on it in one hand and the torch in the other. 


- Put a tiny puff of the gas into each ampule then immediately seal it with the torch. Be careful that you do not point the torch at the syringe or needle. 


**2.** **Helium**

*Ampule*

- Get a Helium balloon. Using a 60cc syringe with a needle on the end, stab into the ballon close to where it  is tied in a knot. 

- fill up the syringe with the gas. You can twist the balloon below the hole that you made and then clamp it off with kelly forceps until you are ready to fill the syringe again.

*Put the Gas into the glass ampules*

- Fill up the aluminum block with ampules and light the torch. Put the syringe with a needle on it in one hand the torch in the other. 
- Put a tiny puff of the gas into each ampule then immediately seal it with the torch.
- be careful you do not point the torch at the syringe or needle.


**3.** **Lithium**

*Ampule*

*Prepare the lithium*

- hammer a piece of lithium flat. it should be about as thin as 8 pieces of paper. Put the piece of lithium in mineral oil until you are ready to cut it up. 
- take the hammered piece of lithium out of the oio and wipe off the majority of the oil. 
- On a piece of aluminum cut the lithium into thin strips using a blade. these strips should be thin enough that they can fit into the opening of an ampule. 
- Once you have about 10 strips. line them all up and get them even with each other.
- cut the strip int eh other directions into pieces about 4mm long. 
- Put a drop of oil on the pieces to prevent them from oxidizing. 

*fill the ampules*

- fill up the aluminum block with ampules.

- Using kelly forceps(Or tweezers), grab a cut piece of lithium and slide it all the way into the ampule. It helps if you grab the pieces near the top so that there is enough of the piece exposed under the forceps to stick it in the top of the ampule.
After you place a piece in all the ampules, push the pieces all the way to the bottom of each tube using a needle. 


- Seal the tops of all the ampules with the torch.make sure to wear safety glasses. Sometimes the oil in the ampules can catch on fire and shoot out. If there is a tiny pinhole in the ampule after you seal it then the torch needs to have been help on the tube longer. If you hear a tiny pop while you are sealing tan ampule, then that most likely means that the torch was held a little too long on the end and there is now a tiny hole in it. Try to keep you seals from ballooning. 
- To fix any of these issues mentioned in above paragraph, just go over the end of the ampule again to reseal it. Sometimes holes in the end of the ampule will not seal up, they will catch on fire, or they will become black and brittle. In these cases just throw away the ampule. 
- Make more ampules than are needed because some of them will oxidize and go bad. For Lithium, make about 50% more than is needed. 
- After you have made enough ampules wash them with warm soapy water. 
rinse them with water until there isn't any soap left. 


- dry them off with a paper towel or lay them out on a paper towel to air dry. 


*Check for oxidized ampules*

- It takes lithium about two weeks to fully oxidize.

- Sort through the ampules to double-check that they are all good. throw out any that are too large , too small, empty, or have oxidized. When the lithium ampules oxidize, they turn white and powdery

**4.** **Beryllium Hazmat**

- Turn the knob on the top of the tank.


* Place the end of the torch pointing into a 60cc syringe.
- Follow the oxygen line down opening any knobs along the way.
- Carefully turn the last knob to fill the open syringe with oxygen.
- Insert the syringe plunger into the end of the oxygen-filled syringe.
- When you are done filling the necessary number of syringes close all of the
were opened.

*Put the Gas into glass ampules.*


- Fill up the aluminum block with ampules and light the torch. Put the syringe with a needle on it in one hand and the torch in the other.
- Put a tiny puff of the gas into each ampule then immediately seal it with the torch.
- Be careful that you do not point the torch at the syringe or needle.


**9.** **Fluorine**

**10.** **Neon** 

*Really Expensive! Do not waste!*


*Get the gas from the tank*

- Thread the regulator onto the Neon tank and tighten with a wrench.
- Make sure that the regulator knob is closed (turned counterclockwise).
- Open the tank by turning the knob on top of the tank. The gauge on the right should

 - With the regulator hose pointed in an open 60cc syringe, carefully turn the regulator knob clockwise to fill up the syringe with gas. keep filling up syringes until all of the gas that was in the regulator is gone. gas will stop flowing and the regulator gauge on the right will show that there is not any pressure in the regulator anymore. 
- Insert the syringe plunger into the end of the gas-filled syringe. 

*Put the gas into glass ampules.*

- Fill up the aluminum block with ampules and light the torch. Put the syringe with a needle on it in one hand and the torch in the other. 




11. Sodium

*Ampule*


*Fill the ampules*


- Sodium is very reactive with water. Make sure that you wear a face shield while working with it. 
- To prevent it from oxidizing while you work with it try not to breathe on it too much and make sure that it is always covered in mineral oil. 
- Sodium can also react with the moisture on your skin and form a base that can irritate your skin. 


- If you get sodium Or oil that has come in contact with sodium on your skin, wash with warm soap and water:
- Cut a chunk of sodium so that it is about 5mm thick and lay it on a small block of aluminum.
- Push an ampule down into the piece of sodium to put a core of sodium into the ampule and place it in the aluminum block. Repeat this until you have done about 10 ampules (If you are new only do 3)
- Once there are holes over the entire piece of sodium just squish it back together. After doing this a few times you may notice that a high percentage of the ampules will catch
on fire or fail when you are trying to seal them. When you get to this point discard the piece of sodium in a safe way. 
-Do not put it in the trash because it will catch on fire and
is dangerous.
- Push the sodium to the bottom of each ampule with a needle


*Seal all the ampules with the torch.*


- The Sodium will react with the air if the ampules are sitting too long before they are sealed. If you notice that they are oxidizing then quickly seal them up and fill less at a time in your next batch. If you fill the ampules up too much and the sodium is too close to the top of the ampule then the sodium will catch on fire and could send out a little
fireball. If this happens then throw away the burnt ampules and take out smaller cores next time. What determines if this is an issue is less about how much sodium is in the
ampule and more about how close the sodium is to the top of the ampule when it is pushed to the bottom. The sodium should be at least 3mm away from the top of the
ampule when you finish pushing it to the bottom.
- If there is a tiny pinhole in the ampule after you seal it then the torch needs to have been held on the tube longer. If you hear a tiny pop while are are sealing an ampule, then that most likely means that the torch ws held a little too long on the end and there is now a tiny hole in it. try to keep your seals from ballooning. 
- To fix any of these issues, just go over the end of the ampule again to reseal it. 


- Sometimes holes at the end of the ampule will not seal up, they will catch fire, or they will become black and brittle. In these cases just throw away the ampule. Make more ampules then are needed because some of them will oxidize and go bad. For sodium, make about 60% more than is needed. 
After you have made enough ampules wash them with warm soapy water. 
- Rinse them with water until there isn't any soap left.
- Dry them off with a paper towel or set them out on a paper towel to dry.

*check for oxidized ampules*

- It takes sodium about 2 weeks to fully oxidize. 
- Sort through the ampules to double-check that they are all good. throw out any that are too large, too small, empty, or have oxidizes/ When sodium ampules oxidize, the ampule will be empty, have clear liquid in it, or become very bubbly inside.

**17.** **Chlorine**

*Ampule*

* Fill a small syringe with bleach and put the smallest possible needle on the end. Bleach will decompose into chlorine gas. Make sure that there is not any air in the syringe
* Fill up the aluminum block with empty ampules
Barely push down the plunger of the syringe so that you can just barely see a drop of liquid forming. It may help to just twist the end of the plunger to prevent a full drop of bleach from forming on the end of the needle


* Stick the end of the needle into the ampule to just get a small coating of bleach on the inside of
the ampules.
- Seal the ampules within the torch. It may
help to go over the ampules quickly with the torch at
high heat to get all of the extra bleach and bubbles out.


**18.** **Argon**

*Ampule*

*Get the gas from the tank*

- Thread the regulator onto the Argon tank and tighten with a
wrench
- Make sure that the regulator knob is closed (turned counterclockwise).
_Open the tank by turning the knob on top of the tank. The gauge on the right should indicate that there is air pressure in the regulator.
- With the regulator hose pointed in an open 60cc syringe, carefully turn the regulator knob clockwise to fill up the syringe with gas. Insert the syringe plunger into the end of the gas-filled syringe
- When you are done filling the necessary number of syringes, close all of the valves on the tank and regulator. 


- You do not need to remove the regulator from the tank.


*Put the Gas into glass ampules*


* Fill up the aluminum block with ampules and light the torch. Put the syringe with a needle on it in one hand and the torch in the other.
* Put a tiny puff of the gas into each ampule then immediately seal it with the torch.
* Be careful that you do not point the torch at the syringe or needle.

**19.** **Potassium**


*Ampule*


*Fill the ampules*

point discard the piece of potassium in a safe way. Do not put it in the trash because it
will catch on fire and is dangerous.
- Push the sodium to the bottom of each ampule with a needle
Seal all the ampules with the torch.
- The potassium will react with the air if the ampules are sitting too long before they are
sealed. If you notice that they are oxidizing then quickly seai them up and fill less at a
time in your next batch.
- If you fill the ampules up too much and the potassium is too
close to the top of the ampule then the potassium will catch on fire and could send out a
little fireball. 
- If this happens then throw away the burnt ampules and take out smaller
cores next time. 
- What determines if this will be an issue is less about how much
potassium is in the ampule and more about how close the potassium is to the top of the
ampule.

- Seal the tops of all of the ampules with the torch. 
- Make sure to wear safety glasses.
Sometimes the oil in the ampules can catch on fire
shoot out. 
- If there is a tiny
pinhole in the ampule after you seal it then the torch needs to have been held on the
tube longer. If you hear a tiny pop while you are sealing an ampule, then that most likely
means that the torch was held a little too long on the end and there is now a tiny hole in
it. Try to keep your seals from ballooning. 

- To fix any of these issues, just go over the end
of the ampule again to reseal it. Sometimes holes at the end of the ampule will not seal
up, they will catch on fire, or they will become black and brittle. In these cases just throw
ampules than are needed because some of them will
away the ampule. 

- Make more
oxidize and go bad. For europium, make about 50% more than is needed

- After you have made enough ampules, wash them with warm soapy water.
- Rinse them with water until there isn't any soap left.
- Dry them off with a paper towel or lay them out on a paper towel to air dry.


*Check for oxidized ampules*

- It takes europium about 2 weeks to fully oxidize.
Sort through the ampules to double-check that they are all good. - Throw out any that are
too large, too small, empty, or have oxidized. When europium ampules oxidize, they turn
chartreuse yellow and powdery.
